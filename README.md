Some people have the skills but don't know what to build with them. I know what to build, but I don't have the skills to do so.
I want to be Richard Hendricks but I'm Erlich Bachman.

Random hot takes:
- Not everything should be built with node.js
- UX will never be good if DX is trash
- Don't try to fix a problem that isn't there
- Crypto is a facade and putting your "decentralized" currency in a "centralized" exchange is absolutely insane
- Someone's code editor doesn't say as much about them as you may think (yeah, I use VSCode, how did you know?)
